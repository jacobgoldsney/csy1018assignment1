            The junior web developer roles that I researched all had very similar traits, requirements, benefits and other skills needed to get the job at that company. In the first job I researched there was a list of essential skills which an applicant should have. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, PHP and wordpress. Also it provided a list of “desirable skills” which would be useful to have and would improve your chances of getting the job. This list includes Adobe creative suite, Drupal, Joomla, E-commerce, Linux/Lamp server, SSH/Command line and PHP frameworks. <br><br>
            When looking at the 2nd and 3rd roles contained lists of skills that they specifically required, however they both had very similar lists of required skills. With additional research I found that a large percentage of the junior website development roles that were available all had very similar lists for required skills. <br><br>
            One thing that I did notice from my research is that the three jobs I found did not have an explicit amount of experience that they required, however if you did not have the required skills from the list then you would likely not get the job. Another point is that all of these roles involve working within teams of developers where you would learn from them and work with them. <br><br>
            The average pay grade per annum ranged quite largely, however there is a range of £20-30,000 which is where a broad amount of the roles come under. But as none of these jobs require any formal experience they would be an excellent starting point for any website developer, as in some cases they mention having willingness to move into a senior role.
