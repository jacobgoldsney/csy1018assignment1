        <h1>My Pathway</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Networks are a vital component of the modern world and our dependence on technology further increases the importance of maintaining networks. As a network engineer it is your responsibility to maintain the services provided by networks, amongst a wide range of other roles. Some examples of roles you can expect to do as a network engineer include:<br><br>
          <strong>-</strong>The design and implementation of new networks and improving security of the current environment;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	Maximizing network efficiency by monitoring performance, troubleshooting network problems, scheduling upgrades and collaborating with other network engineers on optimising the network;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	Securing networks by creating and enforcing security policies, and defining and controlling access;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	Keeping up-to-date by participating in educational opportunities, reading professional publications and maintaining personal networks;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	Updating network equipment to the latest stable firmware releases;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	Configuration of routing and switching equipment;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	Configuration of firewalls;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	remote troubleshooting;<br>
          <strong>-</strong>	capacity management and IP addressing/management 
          <strong>-</strong>	Communicating with project managers, other engineers and service desk engineers on a regular basis;<br><br>
          There are various qualifications that will help in pursuing a career in network engineering, the first of which is a computing related degree, helps securing a job in this field, however it is favourable if it is a networking specific degree. Also, there are various cisco qualifications which are industrially recognised and important to upkeeping your knowledge. <br><br>
          To me, being a network engineer is something that I find interesting because I enjoy solving problems and keeping up-to-date with computer technology. Maintaining and monitoring my personal devices and network is something which I do, and enjoy, anyway so learning how to use more advanced technologies is something that I would consider a hobby.
