        <p>Me: Jacob Goldsney</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m Jacob, 19, and I have lived in Northampton all my life. I chose computing as a pathway after failing at dropping out of sixth form and going to college instead where I did Level 3 network and systems support. My intended career is to follow the network engineering pathway as I pretty much hate every other it role available. I enjoy listening to music and playing games to waste my time. </p>

        <p>Colleague: Andrew Gilbert</p><!-- Andrew Gilberts Bio Written by himself to be used on both his and my website-->
        <p>I'm Andrew Gilbert, I'm 25, have lived in Wellingborough Northamptonshire for the majority of my life. I was a qualified HGV mechanic but decided to change my career and came back to university having first gone through a level 3 BTEC in computing at Tresham College.
          <br><br>
          I choose Northampton University as it is local to my home and having got married over the summer didn't want my wife to have to relocate with me. In my free time I’m a keen gamer, biker and enjoy archery. I currently own a CBR 600 F 1999/2000 model which I bought as a non-runner and have rebuilt myself.
          <br><br>
          Overall I am enjoying my course, however I am not interested in Web Development so I find it much harder than the other topics we are currently covering. When I finish I hope to become either a hardware technician, a network engineer or a network maintenance engineer. I would like to work for companies like: BT or Virgin as a network engineer for businesses using their packages.</p>
